## :ice_hockey: Sports Dashboard
A local hockey league web application.
<br>
<br>
I re-created an existing website with updated styles and features. The existing website was built with Squarespace. My web application was built using HTML/CSS/JS/REACT/FIREBASE. 
<br>
<br>
The divisions can be updated if logged in as an administrator in real-time. New users can be created by an admin and given division add/delete priviledges. Authentication handled through Firebase 9. Page routing uses react-router-dom version 6. 

#### HTML/CSS/JS/REACT/FIREBASE
